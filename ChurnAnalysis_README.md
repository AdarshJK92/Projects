# Projects- Churn Analysis

Analysis performed on Telco customer churn dataset found on kaggle.

1) Download the dataset onto the local machine.
2) Perform exploratory data analysis, refactor variables based on project need and understand correlation between different variables.
3) Split into test train after checking for data imbalance. Imbalance is corrected here by applying SMOTE.
4) Build required machine learing models(random forest in the file uploaded) and plot the outputs.
